# Carousel-Slideshow
To create a Carousel/Slideshow with 6 different images of my choice. Ensure the following:
The images are properly styled.
Directional icons (previous and next Icons ) will be shown on the images only when hovered
On clicking the icons, it will show the next/previous image. 
When the next icon on the last image is clicked, it will show the first image.
When the previous icon on the first image is clicked, it wil show the last image.
